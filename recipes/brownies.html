    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These brownies are incredibly rich, fudgy, and packed with chocolate flavor. They are the perfect dessert for any chocolate lover, with a dense, moist center and a crackly top.</p>
    <p>They are easy to make from scratch and taste so much better than a box mix!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the melted butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Add the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder to the bowl. Stir until just combined; do not overmix.</li>
        <li>If using, gently fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs (not wet batter).</li>
        <li>Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.</li>
    </ol>
